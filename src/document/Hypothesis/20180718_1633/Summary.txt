	Conclusion
		Precision and F-score are ill-defined and being set to 0.0 in labels with no predicted samples
	
	Diagnose and solution
		1. 	Noise in dataset
				Remove noise
		2. 	Bug-commits are so few
				Increase the bug commit data
		3. 	Features are not clear
				Add another feature (apply NLP?)
