Precondition
	Pre-solution
		Remove noise is not approriately - Causing losing data and not be able to generalize sample space
		Applying logirithm 10 to all features - Data visualization is now better

	Conclusion
		SVM model can predict bug commit but still very low
	
	Diagnose and solution
		1. 	Bug-commits are so few
				Increase the bug commit data
		2. 	Features are not clear
				Add another feature (apply NLP?)
